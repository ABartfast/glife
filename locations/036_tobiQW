'(Do_You) - The owner Karin?'
'(Toby) - Oh, holy simplicity. Of_Course, Karin saved you from the evil Toby and teach you magic. she horoshoya, Toby bad and the ugly. what naivety. Karin a pawn in someone else`s game.'
'(Toby) - sit_down, we have a long conversation, kill you I`m not going, if going, I would not sharpen fritters with you.'
'You sat on the bed. Toby began to tell.'
'(Toby) - When I took the amulet, I do not take you miscalculated, I did not know that the power passed to you. When I came back to the room, you were gone, and there was no trace of, who is clearly very well cleaned up all traces. This someone, not weaker than me. Remember this fact, Karin silenok not enough so Close to Me.'
'(Toby) - The next day I find out about your alleged death. And here the owner Karin made вЂ‹вЂ‹his biggest mistake.'
'(Do_You) - what? Everything seems to go smoothly.'
'(Toby) - Yes_I_Am, all passed smoothly, we waited for the funeral of the body and then it got. Perfect copy, masterful, Karin can not do it, but I did not even know about its existence.'
'(Toby) - But the owner Karin though many know about the Order of Dawn, but still not enough. He did not know, that Payne, has the ability to find the souls of the dead and bring them back to life. We returned to the body for life and turned, that this person has nothing to do with you. Someone just took a passerby on the street, Make him your appearance and killed him. Payne just has the ability to see everything in person, even the time of his birth, and the eyes of the man, Unfortunately this spell kills guinea. Payne saw all.'
'(Do_You) - nifiga Statement, What`s that for a Payne?'
'(Toby) - Payne, the true owner of everything, that is in the tomb. He is a true master of the force, that you. He avatar Rikudo, the living embodiment of the god, capable of destroying a city traffic, raise the dead, see through people, change his body as he pleases, have plenty of bodies at the same time, control the weather, gravity, live in several worlds, see the entire continent of his eye, like_this, that even the mouse does not slip from his sight, and God knows what he owns, it is incomprehensible even to me.'

'(Do_You) - So who is the owner of Karin and that he should?'
'(Toby) - This is the most interesting! But to continue the order. When Payne checked memory depicting the corpse you, he did not see the face magician, but I heard his voice, vile snake hiss, it could only be Orochimaru.'
'(Do_You) - Orochimaru? Never heard of such a.'
'(Toby) - not surprisingly. He was not looking, that would head off tear only dead mages and lazy. But his name does not even try to say out loud, and then suddenly courted him on his head, He is a real threat for strong magicians. We`ve had some good friends with him, he was in Breaking Dawn.'
'(Toby) - He is an exceptionally gifted magician, very wise, ancient and immortal sorcerer. Owns nearly all the possible techniques of Magic, many of his techniques beyond comprehension.'
'(Toby) - But Orochimaru paid dearly for immortality. There is no eternal life without eternal pay for it. His real body has long died, he lives in a foreign bodies. These donors bodies referred vessels, They receptacle of his soul. But the vessels do not live long, all three, four years, then the vessel rejects soul Orochimaru. And the power of Orochimaru is limited by the vessel.'
'(Toby) - so, after inspection body, it became clear, you out from under our nose led Orochimaru. We began to track it, Pain can differentiate amongst all, that is in the rain, it was he who sheds his so often. We tracked down this way Orochimaru, he once showed his snake `s face in the rain. But there was no sign of, he took power itself. We concluded, that you are still alive, technology will allow Orochimaru to crank the most unexpected focus.'
'(Do_You) - So how do you track me and what I need Orochimaru.'
'(Toby) - Oh stupid youth. Yes Orochimaru wants your body to make a vessel for your soul. He trained with the help of Karin and you developed, what would your body came into full force, do not forget, its level is tied to the strength of the vessel.'
'(Toby) - Karin wanted to spit on you, it develops your body, for, whatever her master Orochimaru could use it as a new vessel. Do you even know what fate has prepared you Karin? You just erase your place and take Orochimaru.'
'you think "Damn, I`m between a rock and a hard place Toby as Orochimaru, and what to do now?"'
'(Toby) - Swapping your floor Orochimaru made вЂ‹вЂ‹you useless for me and Payne, We do not need or do not need. frankly, spit us now on you. I continued to look for you, Only the desire to razobratsya situation. Orochimaru plans to understand this force.'
'(Toby) - Zetsu and had to use as a spy and that would force Payne to track all magicians, We found Karin, but we do not know, but we found Juugo, and only then we will know exactly what he is is. He Orochimaru experiment.'
'(Toby) - Then Payne saw you. How do you go to Karin and she teaches you, Payne saw as you leap through the levels magicity. Any magician decades to grow your current level. And how much do you have time for this needed? You techniques rehearsed for an hour, and magicians for years they are taught. It became clear, you imagine yourself. So I came to your house.'

'(Toby) - Do not think, that magicians are all the same, that if one could then, else will be able to accurately. No, I have no idea how Orochimaru did, what he did to you. And it was he, instead of Karin. You did not surprise, she even treat you can not? She is too weak for such tricks with the body.'
'(Toby) - And now to the main. Yes_I_Am, you are not interested for us, we really can not take your power now. But this does not mean, we just give up such a powerful vessel Orochimaru.'
'(Toby) - I would have already tried to kill Orochimaru, or sent Payne do it, I think Payne easily have killed him in battle. The problem is, that `s fine .'

If it makes anyone any of the Dawn, Orochimaru will understand, and so he will try to capture your own. You need him as a vessel .'

'(Toby) - We are all united by one goal, Tsukuemi maintain in working order, For this. It is a hard and rewarding work. And we do it for the sake of humanity that would have existed.'
'(Toby) - Yes_I_Am, You heard right, we do it for the people. We remember those days, when people knew about magic, it was a time of constant war, humanity chokes blood. Magee went to war at the age of 6 - 10 year_old, survived at least until 16 units. All fought against all. Violence begets violence. me in 7 years during the fight broke up the right side of the face. I lost an eye and became compelled to hide it, what was left of my face behind the mask. I went out the mighty magician, which then killed. All the people I knew and loved, killed and I could not do anything about it. You just can not imagine a world in which almost all the magicians with the forces capable of destroying entire cities. Banal drunken brawl in a bar wrapped in a bloody mess with thousands of victims. People ran wild and destroy each other. Mankind fell on the edge of the abyss. Then I decided to put an end to this massacre not died.'
'(Toby) - I founded the Order of Dawn. In the beginning we were just mercenaries, We need the money, we have been in the order only very strong magicians, then I met Payne, he. We combined usliya, captured demons and I created Tsukuemi.'
'(Toby) - Tsukuemi causes people not to believe in magic, it makes forget about it. Gradually reduced the number of magicians. And finally forgot all about magic.'

'(Toby) - Of course . Therefore. At Dawn has no friends, only enemies, except we still have a whole bunch of magicians who managed to escape the influence of Tsukuemi, For example, they are at every opportunity we try to insert a stick in the wheel. But we shouldered this burden voluntarily and bear your cross for humanity as a whole, rather than a handful of magicians who want to assert themselves. Particularly zealous magicians, going to seize power we consume, those who try to intrude into the work Tsukuemi we also destroy. Others do not touch, until they are on the rampage. Well, with them we did not reconcilable war.'

Payne forces generally something otherworldly, Maybe you can so that he has to learn, but not now. I would like to, what would you teach Kakuzu. But he has a very nasty character. He will not teach you for free, even if I ask. He is the oldest of living on the planet, and the most greedy, I will ask him, that he would have taught you, but it zli, and he will kill you, Seriously. I`m not just saying, Kakuzu that the most harmful of all the old man living, he did not just kill their mates. I forgive him everything only from the fact, that he was the only one in the world has simultaneously by all schools of magic.'
'(Toby) - Here are harmful to this old man, I want you to send. Find it in the northern region. Here`s a piece of paper with his address. And I have to go.'
