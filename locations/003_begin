'<b>Original Start:</b>'
'You are Michael Kuznetsov, a fairly average, 35 year old businessman whose life is about to be turned inside out. Features magic and an (incomplete) over-arching plot. Beware of unintelligible translations.'

'<b>Alternate Start:</b>'
'You are a 15-year-old small-town girl about to start her first year of high school. Name and starting stats are customizable, no magic and no major ''plot'' other than <i>life</i>. Not to say that your classmates and family don''t have their own stories, though!'
