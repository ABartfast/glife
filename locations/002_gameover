	"You're mad and started to run around town naked screaming 'I am a man!'. You quickly alerted the police and you were taken to a metal hospital. There you got put in a straitjacket and placed in a room with soft walls. You spent the rest of your days in happy delusions about your family and about being a man again. But the delusions never became reality."

	'Hint:'
	'When your mood falls, your mind weakens and finally breaks. Do not forget, it is difficult for a normal man to come to terms with the fact that he is now a woman. In order to keep your mood and psyche at an acceptable level make sure you are of healthy weight, have at least a TV and visit the psychotherapist. Strengthening your will and intellect also increases the maximum value of your mood, such that the harmful effects will not be as devastating.'

Here you´ve got it, witch kept her promise and turned you into a jerk at the station.'
	'So you spent the rest of your days swallowing shit until 50 years later, the train station is not started to repair and you just broke and took the pieces to the dump.'

if over = 6:'You suddenly feel a sharp piercing pain in the abdomen, then another and another. "Greetings to you from the boys" says a figure with downcast eyes while it moves away. You realize you are standing in a puddle of your own blood, and have multiple stab wounds in your stomach. The last thing you saw was the fast approaching land.'

if over = 7:'The last thing you saw was a police baton, flying into your face. You were beaten to death, and your early surmise was written in as an accident.'
