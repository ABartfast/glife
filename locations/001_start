*nl
'0.2.5:'
'- Added a lot more hairstyles'
'-- For the numberphiles between you, there are 216 ways to style your hair, 175 have pictures.'
'-- Cheat Menu to tinker around with your hair, it also tells you how your current hair looks.'
'- Added the Hairsalon in the Mall'
'- Added the Barbershop in the small town, cheaper & faster than the hairsalon, but doesn''t do braided hair'
"- While I'm not a native english speaker, I tried to fix some of the broken english"
'-- Done in following locations: street, down, Nord, club, park'
'- Additional conditions to get into the club.'
'-- Jeans, Shorts, Pants and Kis-Clothes can get you in.'
'--- Jeans, Shorts and Pants require a certain level of looks/beauty (vnesh) to get you in.'
'---- When you wear a skirt or shorts, you now should make sure, you shaved your legs. The folks guarding the entrance don''t like hairy legs.'
'- Excluded the rape events at the home street for now.'
'- VIP-Card price at the night club lowered from 50.000 to 10.000 rubles, as the price of one card stood in no, for me at least, comprehensible relation to other prices.'
'- The park is now a central park, from where you can walk to the others citys districts if you so desire.'
'-- Homestreet -> Park => roughly 20 Minute Walk'
'-- City Center -> Park => roughly 48 Minute Walk'
'-- Northern District -> Park => roughly an hour of walking.'
'--- Once you are in the park, it takes the same amount of time to get to another respectable area.'
'- Excluded the direction argument ''prost'' inside the location ''park'', as nothing links to it (anymore). Prostitution itself takes place in a location called ''prostitute''. ''prost'' seems to be the remnant of an older version of ETO. It should be safe to remove, if no gamebreaking bugs appear.'
'- TFGS-user "kevlar" pointed out a bug in the fitness studio, you get a Debug-Message once you win the amateur fight. This bug occured due to a spelling mistake and has been fixed.'
