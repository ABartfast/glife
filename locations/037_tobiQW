We got the body for life and it turned out that this man has nothing to do with you. Someone just took a passerby in the street, he created your appearance and killed him. Payne also has the ability to see everything in a person, even when he is born, and the eyes of this man, unfortunately it kills guinea spell. Payne saw everything.'

'(You) - So who´s the boss and that Karin does he want?'
'(Toby) - This is the fun part! But to continue in order. When Payne checked memory corpse depicting you, he did not see the face of magician, but I heard his voice, vile snake hiss, it could only be Orochimaru.'
'(You) - Orochimaru? Never heard of such a thing.'
'(Toby) - not surprising. He was not looking for that would head off to tear only dead mages and lazy. But his name did not even try to say out loud, and then suddenly courted him on his head, he is a real threat to the powerful magicians. We were once close friends with him, he was in the Dawn.'
'(Toby) - He is an exceptionally gifted magician, a very wise, ancient and immortal sorcerer. Owns nearly all the possible techniques of magic, many of his techniques beyond comprehension.'
'(Toby) - But Orochimaru pay dearly for immortality. There is no eternal life without eternal fee for it. His real body has long been dead, he lives in the wrong bodies. These bodies are called donor vessels, they receptacle of his soul. Vessels but do not live long, only three or four years, then the vessel rejects soul Orochimaru. And Orochimaru is limited by the strength of the vessel.'
'(Toby) - So, after examination of the body, it became clear you out from under our nose led Orochimaru. We began to stalk him, Payne can differentiate amongst all that is in the rain, it was he who sheds it so often. We tracked down Orochimaru manner he once showed his face snake in the rain. But there was no sign that he took power himself. We have concluded that, as before, you alive, Orochimaru technology allow crank most unexpected focus.'
'(You) - Since you tracked me and why I need Orochimaru.'
'(Toby) - Ah youth stupid. Yes Orochimaru wants to make your body a vessel for the soul. He trained with the help of Karin and you developed, what would your body came into full force, do not forget, its level is tied to the strength of the vessel.'
'(Toby) - Karin spit at you like, it develops your body for what would be her master Orochimaru could use it as a new vessel. Do you even know what fate has prepared for you, Karin? You just erase your place and take Orochimaru.'
'You think "Damn, I´m in between a rock and a hard place Toby as Orochimaru, and what to do now?"'
'(Toby) - To change your floor Orochimaru made you useless for Payne and me, we do not need you or do not need. Frankly, we spit on you now. I continued to look for you, but out of a desire to razobratsya situation. Understand Orochimaru plans to this effect.'
'(Toby) - I had to use and Zetsu as a spy, and that would force Payne track all magicians, we found Karin, but it is not known to us, but we found Juugo, and only then we will know exactly what he represents. He experiment Orochimaru.'
'(Toby) - Then Payne saw you. How do you go to Karin and she teaches you, Paine saw as you leap through the levels magicity. Any magician decades to grow your current level. How old are you this time it took? You were practicing a technique for an hour, and magicians for years they are taught. It became clear that you imagine yourself out. So I came to visit you.'

'(Do_You) - Orochimaru? Never heard of such a.'
'(Toby) - not surprisingly. He was not looking, that would head off tear only dead mages and lazy. But his name does not even try to say out loud, and then suddenly courted him on his head, He is a real threat for strong magicians. We`ve had some good friends with him, he was in Breaking Dawn.'
'(Toby) - He is an exceptionally gifted magician, very wise, ancient and immortal sorcerer. Owns nearly all the possible techniques of Magic, many of his techniques beyond comprehension.'
'(Toby) - But Orochimaru paid dearly for immortality. There is no eternal life without eternal pay for it. His real body has long died, he lives in a foreign bodies. These donors bodies referred vessels, They receptacle of his soul. But the vessels do not live long, all three, four years, then the vessel rejects soul Orochimaru. And the power of Orochimaru is limited by the vessel.'
'(Toby) - so, after inspection body, it became clear, you out from under our nose led Orochimaru. We began to track it, Pain can differentiate amongst all, that is in the rain, it was he who sheds his so often. We tracked down this way Orochimaru, he once showed his snake `s face in the rain. But there was no sign of, he took power itself. We concluded, that you are still alive, technology will allow Orochimaru to crank the most unexpected focus.'
'(Do_You) - So how do you track me and what I need Orochimaru.'
'(Toby) - Oh stupid youth. Yes Orochimaru wants your body to make a vessel for your soul. He trained with the help of Karin and you developed, what would your body came into full force, do not forget, its level is tied to the strength of the vessel.'

'(Toby) - Zetsu and had to use as a spy and that would force Payne to track all magicians, We found Karin, but we do not know, but we found Juugo, and only then we will know exactly what he is is. He Orochimaru experiment.'
'(Toby) - Then Payne saw you. How do you go to Karin and she teaches you, Payne saw as you leap through the levels magicity. Any magician decades to grow your current level. And how much do you have time for this needed? You techniques rehearsed for an hour, and magicians for years they are taught. It became clear, you imagine yourself. So I came to your house.'

Then I decided to put an end to this massacre not died.'
