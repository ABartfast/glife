				'You undressed and lay down on the couch, Karin began to examine you. She dabbed what that charms to you and use a variety of devices. Cherz half hour examination, she sighed and told you to get dressed.'
				'You got up from the couch and dressed. You asked Karin "So what? Teach me anything else?"'
				'(Karin) - Okay. But only in theory. Listen closely and listen hard, I will not repeat. To begin to tell about magic. Magical energy in Asian culture it is called chakra is produced by all living organisms. This vital energy, deprived her body begins to slowly die. Striking symptom of the lack of magical energy is in a bad mood. In itself it can not kill, but it undermines the mind, body and the mind exhausting, eventually either the body does not survive, or mind.'
				'That is magical energy there in the grass, and trees, and people do not have it in dead matter. It is the energy of life itself, what awakens the lifeless living. She and you have been and there, the body protects itself by itself, prohibiting use this energy. This exhausts the body and can kill him. Mages are able to simply bypass the body''s defenses and separating themselves from the magical energy to convert it into what that action. The main task of a magician is the maximum their potential and learn to draw your energy as much as possible. But mages can not scoop up more energy than they contain. In something you''re lucky you came in as much energy as none magician asked. You just need to learn how to use it. As I have understood, your orgasms are capable of handling energy Rikudo in his own. But each new stage will be harder given. Maybe there are some ways to recycle what Rikudo energy in your own. But most importantly, your magical energy supply is almost exhausted, unlike other magicians. You know, you''re theoretically the most powerful magician in the world, as the Rikudo was the strongest in history. Perhaps there is art of magic that can only work with the force Rikudo. Most likely in the scrolls are in the dungeon were just what that spells.'
				'(You) - Igor! Igor took one of the scrolls!'
				'(Karin) - Just do not think I''ll be for you to solve your problems. If you want to look for his own Igor.'
				'(You) - I have no idea where he lives. May pay a visit to the trench.'
				'(Karin) - Do you think the Order of Dawn retreated from such findings? Hey, I see you do not quite understand what the Order of Dawn. This is not what that whipping boys. There all the magicians of the highest level. Neither I nor Juugo no good even hold a candle to any of them. Any one of them with us razotret Juugo without straining. They force their combat experience and unique technology. Do not mess with these guys, they are pros in their field. Their main business of destruction of other magicians and capture demons.'
				'(You) - What else for demons?'
				'(Karin) - Demons demons, creatures come to us from other worlds. Possible and Rikudo was a demon, but demons unlike him being though with terrible force, but blunt and aggressive. Something like beasts woven from pure magic.'
				'(You) - a fig. Hey, you can turn me back into a man?'
				'(Karin) - Can. But I will not. You have no idea how much energy it took me, I squeezed myself to dry and Juugo. I barely had enough energy. Now I do not have enough of her physically on the energy consumption of such mad I lost four of her forever. And there''s more to consider now that your body begins to prisposablivatsya magic and I have even harder. This will be possible only if you Bleed is magical at least level 10 and pass me all your energy forever. I can make you again the same, but you''ll never be a magician, this path will be forever closed to you.'
				'(Karin) - You are not to look too far into the future. Develop your body, learn to fight, copy magical force coaches mind. Gradually everything will rise to the location at which all should be.'
